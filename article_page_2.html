    <h1 class="article_page_1_heading">Society maintenance bill over Rs 5,000? Pay 18% GST</h1>
     <p class="article_page_1_description">
        The latest taxation structure has put out tax of 18% on co-operative housing societies that either collect Rs 5,000 per month from a society member or the annual maintenance collection of a society is above Rs 20 lakh
    </p>
    <p class="article_page_1_description">
        Are you paying Rs 5,000 or above every month as your society maintenance charge? If yes, your housing society will have to rework their maintenance bill heads to ensure you or your society do not have to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST).    </p>
    <p class="article_page_1_description">
        "Housing societies are not for making profit. I disagree with the idea and rule of levying taxes on co-operative housing societies. It is a retrograde measure," said Chandrashekhar Prabhu, a housing activist.       </p>
    <p class="article_page_1_description">
        As a result, co-operative housing societies will now have to re-work their maintenance bill heads to bifurcate taxes from the overall maintenance account head. "Multiple heads will have to be created to show taxes that is being paid by the society. The balance maintenance amount and repair fund is what has to be calculated for GST," said Sampat.    </p>
